whenever the N_children_to_terminal increments by one, we should check whether it hits the limit.

when do i assign terminal to a node

what about circles (they exist!)

['N_children']

["leads_to_terminal"]

include multiple paths backpropagate

you must not roll out to a state that is in the up-stream of the node.
